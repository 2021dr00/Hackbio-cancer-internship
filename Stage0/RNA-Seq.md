RNA Seq

Author (@slack): Dharshana Rajkumar (@Dharshana)

RNA sequencing is a technique that analyzes the amount and sequences of RNA in a sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS). This is accomplished through transcriptome analysis, which reveals the active genes encoded in our DNA and to what degree (Mackenzie, 2024).

Sanger sequencing was the first technique used to sequence RNA but was expensive and had low throughput. It was the first generation of sequencing. Today it is the Next generation sequencing which is highly used which are Illumina, PacBio and Oxford Nano-pore. They are high-throughput since they sequence multiple fragments parallelly.

The workflow of RNA-seq has several stages which include the extraction of RNA, reverse transcription into cDNA, adapted ligation, amplification and sequencing (Fig1).

**RNA Seq In Cancer Research**

RNA Seq contributes majorly to cancer research which includes cancer biomarkers, DEGs analysis, cancer drug resistance etc. Differentially expressed gene analysis helps in understanding their function and molecular mechanisms which RNA Seq could reveal (Hong, 2020). DEGs could also serve as cancer biomarkers making RNA sequencing an important factor in cancer research. RNA Seq revealed that Tumour Mutation Burden (TMB) could be used as a cancer biomarker for immune checkpoint therapy and prognosis in diffuse glioma (Wang,2020). IDH mutation has been reported to be a better prognostic biomarker for glioma through RNA-seq (Unruh,2019).

RNA Seq also helps in revealing the mechanisms behind drug resistance in cancer patients. Single-cell RNA Seq identified immature myeloid cells that infiltrate and cause drug resistance (Wang Q, 2019). Similarly, RNA sequencing was used in research on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to compare human pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells with gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cell lines. Two circRNAs were found to be novel biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for gemcitabine-resistant patients (Shao,2018).

RNA sequencing techniques in the past ignored cell-to-cell variations and identified all RNA transcripts present in a particular tissue or cell type. This issue was resolved by single-cell resolution of the transcriptome using transcriptome profiling of single-cell RNA sequencing (Suva,2019). A study of 49 metastatic lung cancer samples through single-cell RNA Seq reported that cancer treatment of NSC-lung cancer induces changes in plasticity which provides a way to understand the clinical treatments (Maynard,2020).

**Conclusion**

RNA Sequencing technology has been rapidly developing. It saves time and cost and provides new insights into research, especially cancer. Combinations of RNA-seq and multi-omics analysis would pave the way for developments in cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.
